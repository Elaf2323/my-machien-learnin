#  Project Idea
Creating a program based on detecting heart diseases using artificial intelligence



# One of the problems we face
- Errors in diagnosing heart disease
- takes more time and effort for doctors and nurses

 # Solve the problem
Using artificial intelligence techniques and algorithms to help detect heart diseases simpler and faster

# Project steps
data:
 - Search and find the right data for it

Machine training:
  - Training the model on a number of algorithms

The final results:
   - After training the machine, we reached a result of 78.68% in the SVM and LR algorithm, which is considered the highest accuracy, and based on that, it will be used.
